Sapona Plastics is committed to reducing adverse environmental impacts from our manufacturing activities, products, and services. We are committed to going beyond mere compliance with relevant environmental legislation and regulations, striving for continuous improvement. The company will utilize an environmental management program to achieve the intent of this policy and focus on resource conservation and waste reduction.

## Environmental Programs and Records

- In 2010 Sapona introduced a new product made from recycled tires. The new grill mat replaces a previous thermoformed product.
- Recycled Grill Brush Handle - Plastic handle uses reprocessed/recycled PP, over 600,000 lbs per year of recycled plastic.
- Most scrap produced produced is ground and recycled back into the product unless limited by specification.
Our CEO, Jack Lail, maintains the grounds and keeps the landscaping in good shape.
-Leadership - Dean Lail, our president, is a certified Drinking Water Treatment Facility Operator and certified Distribution System Operator, responsible for the Drinking Water system at Sapona.
- Cans and bottles are recycled by Greg Albright, an employee who has taken the lead on our recycling efforts. Receptacles are in the break room.
- All Electric Presses - Sapona Plastics has 4 all-electric presses which save over 25% electricity compared to traditional hydraulic presses. Future presses and auxilliary equipment will be energy saving. 
- Our electricity usage in 2009 resulted in an estimated equivalent pollution count as follows:
    - 6,548 pounds of nitrogen oxides
    - 23,955 pounds of sulfur dioxide
    - 4,616,034 pounds of carbon dioxide
- EPA Clean Energy
- Lighting Survey - Energy Management Program at NCSU in conjunction with Randolph Electric prepared a survey report of lighting estimating a possible annual savings of $24,000 or 47KW by changing lighting fixtures, lamps and installing occupancy sensors. For every KWh saved, 1.24 pounds of CO2 is not released into the atomosphere. The recommendations are under consideration for implementation.
- In January 2011, Southpoint Solutions replaced all lighting and fixtures in the Sapona Plastics building saving an estimated 345,000 kWh per year and reducing demand by 48KW.  72 existing Metal Halide light fixtures were replaced with CM 4 lamp T8 fixtures from Orion Energy Systems.
- Office areas are collecting and recycling paper routinely.
- In 2011, Sapona formalized a contract with Carolina Container with Sustainable Forestry Initiative certified sourcing.  www.sfiprogram.org
